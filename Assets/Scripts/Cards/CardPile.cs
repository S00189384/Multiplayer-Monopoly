//Script attached to object in scene that represents a card pile.
//The order of the card pile is randomised the same for each client by using the same seed.
//This seed is generated by the master client. 
//Any card taken from the pile is put at the bottom like in real monopoly. 
//Once order of cards is randomised at the start, there is no need to sync the queue across clients as UI on each client grabs a card each simultaneuosly.
